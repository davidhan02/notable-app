# FANTASTIG

Full stack web application using Mongoose, Express, React (with Hooks), and NodeJS. Authentication is done through the usage of JWT tokens and bcrypt.

Live Heroku deployment: https://jhan-notable.herokuapp.com/

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm install --prefix client

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000

};
